    /// Enable "Override Listener Distance" in the <see cref="SoundManager"/>.
    /// Put the AudioListener on the main camera and the <see cref="AudioListenerDistanceBase">AudioListenerDistance</see> on the player character.
    /// Try changing the Amount slider to find a nice balance between the different positions.
